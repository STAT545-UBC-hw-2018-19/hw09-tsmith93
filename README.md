In this repository, you will find the contents of my homework 9. The goal of the assignment was to either add to Jenny Bryan's word pipeline or to make your own. I decided to go with the latter option. 

Here is specificslly what I achieved with my Makefile:

1. Dowloaded Robert De Niro film ratings off of the internet
2. Produced a .csv file
3. Transformed this into a .tsv file
4. Produced a scatter plot in .png format
5. Wrote a .rmd report 
6. Used the .tsv, .rmd, and .png files to produce a .html report
7. Created a flowchart to describe the actions of the pipeline
