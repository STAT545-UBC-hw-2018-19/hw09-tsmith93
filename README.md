# hw09-tsmith93
In this repository, you will find the contents of my homework 9. The goal of the assignment was to either add to Jenny Bryan's word pipeline or to make your own. I decided to go with the latter option. 

Here is specificslly what I achieved with my Makefile:

1. Dowloaded Robert De Niro film ratings off of the internet
2. Produced a .csv file
3. Transformed this into a .tsv file
4. Produced a scatter plot in .png format
5. Wrote a .rmd report 
6. Used the .tsv, .rmd, and .png files to produce a .html report
7. Created a flowchart to describe the actions of the pipeline
